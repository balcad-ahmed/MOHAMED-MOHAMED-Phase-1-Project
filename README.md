Mood Playlist Generator - How It Works

üöÄ Quick Start

Start JSON Server:

bash
json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
Open index.html in your browser

Click any mood to get a playlist!

üèóÔ∏è How the Code is Organized
File Structure:
text
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html     (UI - mood buttons and playlist display)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css      (colors, animations, layout)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js      (brain of the app - handles everything)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ db.json        (song database - like a mini Spotify)
What Each File Does:
index.html - The skeleton

Shows mood selection cards (Happy, Sad, Energetic, etc.)

Displays the playlist results

Contains the Spotify player embeds

style.css - The looks

Makes everything pretty with colors and animations

Handles mobile responsiveness

Creates the floating background particles

script.js - The brain

Listens for mood clicks

Fetches songs from JSON Server

Creates the playlist display

Handles shuffle and back buttons

db.json - The song database

Stores all the songs organized by mood

Each song has: title, artist, Spotify ID, album art

JSON Server turns this into a real API

üîÑ How Songs Are Picked - Step by Step
Step 1: You Click a Mood
javascript
// When you click "Happy":
// 1. App remembers you picked "happy"
// 2. Changes background to happy colors (yellow/pink)
// 3. Hides mood selection, shows playlist area
Step 2: Fetch Songs from JSON Server
javascript
// App makes this request:
GET http://localhost:3000/playlists/happy

// JSON Server responds with:
[
  {
    "title": "Happy",
    "artist": "Pharrell Williams", 
    "spotifyId": "60nZcImufyMA1MKQY3dcCH",
    "albumArt": "https://image.url"
  },
  // more happy songs...
]
Step 3: Display Playlist
javascript
// For each song, create:
// - Song title and artist
// - Album artwork
// - Spotify embed player (using the spotifyId)
Step 4: Music Plays!

üÜò What Happens If Spotify API Doesn't Work
GOOD NEWS: The Spotify API is only used for searching new songs. Our app uses JSON Server + Spotify Embeds which always work!

If We Tried Real Spotify API (We Don't):
javascript
// This is what WOULD happen:
1. Try Spotify API search ‚Üí FAILS
2. Fall back to JSON Server ‚Üí WORKS!
3. Show songs from db.json ‚Üí SUCCESS!
4. Spotify embeds still work ‚Üí MUSIC PLAYS!
Why Our App Always Works:
We use JSON Server as our main data source

Spotify Embeds don't need API keys - they're public

All songs in db.json have real Spotify IDs

No external dependencies - everything is local

üéµ How Music Actually Plays
The Magic of Spotify Embeds:
text
Our App: "Hey Spotify, play track ID 60nZcImufyMA1MKQY3dcCH"
Spotify: "Okay! Here's the player with that song"
User: *Clicks play and music streams from Spotify*
Key Points:
No Spotify account needed to listen

30-second previews work for free

Full songs if you have Spotify account

No API limits - embeds always work

üõ†Ô∏è Student Development Notes
What Makes This a "Student Project":
Simple structure - easy to understand

Minimal dependencies - just JSON Server

Clear separation - HTML/CSS/JS each have one job

Good learning - covers frontend/backend basics

Real-world concepts - APIs, async code, DOM manipulation

Challenges I Overcame:
Learning how JSON Server creates APIs

Understanding async/await for API calls

Making CSS animations work smoothly

Handling different screen sizes

Organizing code in a logical way

‚ùì Troubleshooting
If songs don't load:

Is JSON Server running? (json-server --watch db.json --port 3000)

Check browser console for errors

Make sure all files are in same folder

If music doesn't play:

Check internet connection

Try refreshing the page

Spotify might be blocked on your network

This project shows how frontend and backend can work together to create something fun and useful! üéµ‚ú®
